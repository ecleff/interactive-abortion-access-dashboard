  <div class="quote-box"><i>On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned the constitutional right to abortion as well as the federal standards of abortion access, established by prior decisions in the cases Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Prior to the Dobbs ruling, the federal standard was that abortions were permitted up to fetal viability. That federal standard has been eliminated, allowing states to set policies regarding the legality of abortions and establish limits. </i>
    <div> <i><b>Access to and availability of abortions varies widely between states, with some states banning almost all abortions and some states protecting abortion access.</b></i></div>
